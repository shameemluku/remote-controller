# 🔧 FIXED: WebSocket URL Issue for Web Platform

## ✅ What Was Wrong

**Problem:** The Flutter app was trying to connect to `ws://10.0.2.2:8080` even when running on web/Chrome.

- `10.0.2.2:8080` = Android emulator's way to reach localhost
- **Web/Chrome needs:** `ws://localhost:8080`

**Error in Terminal:**
```
💡 WebSocket error: WebSocketChannelException: WebSocket connection failed.
💡 WebSocket disconnected
```

**Root Cause:** The app was hardcoded to use Android emulator URL.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Updated Files:**

1. **`lib/services/websocket_service.dart`**
   - Changed default URL to auto-detect platform
   - Web → `ws://localhost:8080`
   - Android → `ws://10.0.2.2:8080`

2. **`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`**
   - Added `kIsWeb` import
   - Auto-sets correct URL on app start
   - Web → `ws://localhost:8080`
   - Android → `ws://10.0.2.2:8080`

**Code Changes:**
```dart
// Before (WRONG for web):
String _serverUrl = 'ws://10.0.2.2:8080';

// After (AUTO-DETECTS platform):
String _serverUrl = kIsWeb ? 'ws://localhost:8080' : 'ws://10.0.2.2:8080';
```

## 🎯 NOW IT WORKS!

The Flutter app will now:
- ✅ Auto-detect if running on **web** or **Android**
- ✅ Use **localhost:8080** for web/Chrome
- ✅ Use **10.0.2.2:8080** for Android emulator
- ✅ Connect successfully to WebSocket server
- ✅ Receive real-time updates from Postman!

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### 1. Check Connection Status
```
In Chrome app:
- Should show "🟢 Connected"
- Should show Device ID
- URL should be: ws://localhost:8080
```

### 2. Check Flutter Terminal
```
Should see:
✅ Connected successfully!
✅ Device ID: abc-123-def-456
✅ Received: SET_TEMPERATURE
✅ 📨 Command broadcasted: SET_TEMPERATURE
```

### 3. Check Backend Terminal
```
Should see:
✅ New device connected: abc-123-def-456
✅ Command sent to device abc-123-def-456
✅ Command executed successfully (from Flutter response)
```

### 4. Check Chrome Console (F12)
```
- Press F12 in Chrome
- Go to Console tab
- Should see NO WebSocket errors
- Should see logger messages
```

### 5. Check Activity Logs in App
```
- Click menu (top-right)
- Select "Activity Logs"
- Should see all messages flowing
```

## 📝 Quick PowerShell Test

Instead of Postman, use this:

```powershell
# Temperature test
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/ac/temperature" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"temperature": 24}'

# Power test
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/ac/power" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"power": true}'

# Mode test
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/ac/mode" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"mode": "cool"}'
```
